<h1> Content Baes Image Retrieval </h1>
The process of retrieval of relevant images from an
image database(or distributed databases) on the basis
of primitive (e.g. color, texture, shape etc.) or semantic
image features extracted automatically is
known as Content Based Image Retrieval.</br >
Image drscroptors are applied to our input images. </br >
An image descriptor is an algorithm and methodology that governs how an input image is globally quantified and returns a feature vector abstractly representing the image contents.</br >
To compare two images, we input the respective feature vectors into a distance metric/similarity 
function. The output is a value used to represent and quantify how “similar” the two images are 
to each other.
